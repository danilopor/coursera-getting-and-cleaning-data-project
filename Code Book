Introduction
The script run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variables
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
features contains the correct names for the dataset.
data merges test_data, train_data and subject_data in a big dataset.
Finally, tidy_data contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file.
