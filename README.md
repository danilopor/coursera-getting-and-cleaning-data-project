Course project for Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data"

That is an exercice for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 
The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Read the table in the working directory
Load the activity and feature info
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets
Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy_data.txt.
